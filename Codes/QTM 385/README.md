This class will advance the skills required for the student for successful data analytics. We will cover Python from elementary to advanced programming skills and data wrangling in the first half. In the second half, we will introduce relational databases, provide an overview of SQL (Structured Query Language), and discuss advanced topics in R, such as data scraping and data wrangling.
